## Overview

`r pkg_link("TMB", "cran")` is an **R** package providing a convenient interface to the `r pkg_link("CppAD", "https://coin-or.github.io/CppAD/doc/cppad.htm")` **C++** library for [automatic differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation).  More specifically for the purpose of statistical inference, **TMB** provides an automatic and extremely efficient implementation of [Laplace's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_method) to approximately integrate out the latent variables of a model $p(\xx \mid \tth) = \int p(\xx, \zz \mid \tth) \, \mathrm{d} \zz$ via numerical optimization.  **TMB** is extensively [documented](http://kaskr.github.io/adcomp/_book/Introduction.html), and numerous [examples](http://kaskr.github.io/adcomp/_book/Examples.html#example-overview) indicate that it can be used to effectively handle tens to thousands of latent variables in a model.

**TMB** was designed for users to compile and save standalone statistical models.  Distributing one or more **TMB** models as part of an **R** package requires a nontrivial compilation process (`Makevars[.win]`), and some amount of boilerplate code.  Thus, the purpose of **TMBtools** is to provide helper functions for the development of **R** packages which contain **TMB** source code.  The main package functions are:

- `tmb_create_package()`, which creates an **R** package infrastructure with the proper **TMB** compile instructions.

- `use_tmb()`, which adds **TMB** functionality to an existing package.

- `export_models()`, which updates the package's **TMB** compile instructions when new models are added.

**Note to Developers:** While **TMBtools** depends on a number of packages to facilitate its work, none of these dependencies are passed on to your package, except **TMB** itself.

## Quickstart

Let's start with the canonical example of the model univariate normal model
$$
x_1, \ldots, x_n \iid \N(\mu, \sigma).
$$
The **TMB** C++ file for creating the negative loglikelihood for this model is given below:
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
cat("```cpp",
    readLines("NormalNLL.cpp"),
    "```", sep = "\n")
```
For including this model in a package using **TMBtools**, the code must be modified slightly:

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
cat("```cpp",
    readLines(tmb_sysfile("NormalNLL.hpp")),
    "```", sep = "\n")
```
Most of the changes can be easily spotted, but a few deserving special attention are outlined below:

- In the package, **TMB** models should be in `.hpp` header files as opposed to `.cpp` main files.

- At the time of this writing, **never `#include <TMB.h>` in the header files**.   The reason is that this file is not [include-guarded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_guard), so if the package has multiple model files the C++ compiler will complain.

- The name of the model specified inside the `.hpp` file must *exactly match* the name of the `.hpp` file itself (in this case, `NormalNLL`).  Otherwise, **TMBtools** won't be able to find it.

### Creating an R Package

In order to create an **R**/**TMB** package containing `NormalNLL.hpp`, we can use `tmb_create_package()` as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# in a directory where you want to create the package, which also contains NormalNLL.hpp
TMBtools::tmb_create_package("MyTMBPackage",
                             tmb_files = "NormalNLL.hpp")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
if(!params$local_pkg || params$reinstall) {
  TMBtools::tmb_create_package(file.path(tmbdir, pkgname),
                               tmb_files = "NormalNLL.hpp", open = FALSE)
}
```
This creates a package that is ready to use right out-of-the-box.  In other words, we now run
```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install() # must have devtools installed
```
```{r, include = FALSE}
if(params$local_pkg) {
  if(params$reinstall) {
    devtools::install(file.path(tmbdir, pkgname))
  }
  ## suppressMessages(require(MyTMBPackage))
} else {
  pkgbuild::compile_dll(file.path(tmbdir, pkgname))
  devtools::load_all(file.path(tmbdir, pkgname))
  dyn.load(TMB::dynlib(file.path(tmbdir, pkgname,
                                 "src", paste0(pkgname, "_TMBExports"))))
}
```
Once the package is installed, we can use its **TMB** models very similarly as we would for standalone models:
```{r}
# might have to quit & restart R first, then
# require(MyTMBPackage) 

# create the negative loglikelihood object
x <- rnorm(100) # data
normal_nll <- TMB::MakeADFun(data = list(model = "NormalNLL", x = x),
                             parameters = c(mu = 0, sigma = 1),
                             DLL = "MyTMBPackage_TMBExports", silent = TRUE)

# call the function and its gradients
theta <- list(mu = -1, sigma = 2) # parameter values
normal_nll$fn(theta) # negative loglikelihood at theta
-sum(dnorm(x, mean = theta$mu, sd = theta$sigma, log = TRUE)) # R check
normal_nll$gr(theta) # nll gradient at theta
normal_nll$he(theta) # hessian at theta
```
The notable differences from standalone usage are are:

- The `data` argument to `TMB::MakeADFun()` has an additional argument `model` to specify which package model to use.  Thus we could have different model files `ModelA.hpp`, `ModelB.hpp`, etc., each with their own set of arguments, and we just pick the one to use when the `TMB::MakeADFun()` object is instantiated.

- The `DLL` argument to `TMB::MakeADFun()` must be of the form `{PackageName}_TMBExports`, where `{PackageName}` is the name of the package in which the **TMB** models are to be looked for.

## Adding **TMB** Files

Suppose we wish to add a **TMB** model to the package contained in `NewModel.hpp`.  The simplest way to add this model to **MyTMBPackage** is as follows:

1.  Copy `NewModel.hpp` to `MyTMBPackage/src/TMB`.

2.  Run the command

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    TMBtools::export_models()
    ```

	from within **MyTMBPackage** or any of its subfolders.

3.  Recompile the package.

### Additional `#include` Directives

`TMBtools::export_models()` will assume that all `.hpp` files in `src/TMB` correspond to **TMB** models, and `#include`s each of them into a single standalone-type meta-model file `src/TMB/MyTMBPackage_TMBExports.cpp`, which contains `if/else` switches to select between the individual **TMB** models.  For example, the meta-model file might look like this:
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
cat("```cpp",
    readLines("MyTMBPackage_TMBExports.cpp"),
    "```", sep = "\n")
```

This approach works fine when each **TMB** model is contained in a single `.hpp` file.  For a larger project it might be desirable to use the **C++** `#include` mechanism to organize things.

So let's suppose that `src/TMB/ModelA.hpp` wants to `#include` file `helper.hpp`.  One way to do this is to store it in the package-level subdirectory `inst/include/MyTMBPackage`.  For this to work, we need to tell the **TMB** compiler where to look, which is achieved through the package's `src/Makevars[.win]` file:


```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
cat("```bash",
    readLines(tmb_sysfile("Makevars")),
    "```", sep = "\n")
```
The relevant line is that which begins with `## TMB_FLAGS`.  Indeed, this variable can be used to pass additional flags to the **TMB** compiler.  A common application is to use

```bash
TMB_FLAGS = -I"../../inst/include"
```

To tell the **TMB** compiler to also look for `.hpp` (or other) files in any subdirectory of `inst/include`.  To summarize, `#include`ing `helper.hpp` in `src/TMB/ModelA.hpp` is accomplished in the following steps:

1.  Copy `helper.hpp` to `inst/include/MyTMBPackage`.
2.  Add the `TMB_FLAGS` above to both `src/Makevars` and `src/Makevars.win`.
3.  Add the following line to `src/TMB/ModelA.hpp`:

    ```cpp
    #include "MyTMBPackage/helper.hpp"
    ```

We may note that a slightly simpler alternative is to add `helper.hpp` to e.g., `src/TMB/include`, such that the `#include` directive in `ModelA.hpp` becomes 
```cpp
#include "include/helper.hpp"
```
The advantage of this approach is that the `src/Makevars[.win]` files don't need to be modified.  However, the advantage of the first approach is that storing files in `inst/include` makes them available to developers wanting to `#include` them in other **R**/**TMB** packages, for which the mechanism is to add 
```
LinkingTo: MyTMBPackage
```

<!-- To tell the **TMB** compiler to also look for `.hpp` (or other) files in the package's `inst/include` directory.
